When researching along the way, I used sites like:

[W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp)

[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/)

[Course-notes](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopmentecommerce)

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ie/) :I found this great as the images of different website layout encouraged me to do some research into how to get this on my own website and found I was challenging myself.

I used [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:ital,wght@1,300&family=Roboto&display=swap) and inserted the link into the style.css file


I used Font-awesome to include icons beside a number of headings in the information section to make these icon appear correctly I had to insert this :
https://kit.fontawesome.com/5f12df0b61.js  with a script tag around it.

This README file is all about my first project with code insitute. Titled: "You, but Better".
I decided to build this webpage based off sugguested topic from the brief for this assignment.
This website should be used for general information on the self care establishment based in Tullamore.
It has clearly layout information on class times, class instructors, membership packages, membership costs and what you get for your money with each package.
I've also introduced the staff members displaying a picture, their names and their professional titles.
Although I would have liked to add more to this website, I found myself working against the clock. With this in mind, going forward I will allocate more time for assignments. I also hope to return to this assignment in the further to make improvements with the new knowledge i hope to have then.
I definitely have learnt coding is something you learn by doing and knowledge is power regarding learning or remembering things that make your coding and experience of coding easier and enjoyable.
I also learnt a lot by mistakes, when you spend a lot of time trying to fix a problem or mistake you tend not to forget it easily if it happens again.
I got most of my inspiration for this website from a module completed on this course called "Love Runner" as I feel this was the first time I put all my new found knowledge into action and it was explained really well for me.

# User Experience

## User Stories
As a user I want to be able to navagate across the webpage easily, in order to locate content.

As a user I want to be able to read class times, in order to attend.

As a user I want details on how to sign up and the cost of signing up.

As a user I want to know the benefits of joining a gym.

As a user I want to know the people I will be dealing with when using the gym.

As a user I want to see how the classes are ran before joining.

As a user I want to sign up easily at home.

As a user I want to be able to access their social media easily to keep up with details and events.

When researching along the way, I used sites like:
W3School - https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp
Slack - https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/
Course notes - https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopmentecommerce
Pinterest - https://www.pinterest.ie/ (I found this great as the images of different website layout encouraged me to do some research into how to get this on my own website and found I was challenging myself.) 

I used google fonts and inserted the link into the style.css:
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:ital,wght@1,300&family=Roboto&display=swap

I used font awesome to include icons beside a number of headings in the information section to make these icon appear correctly I had to insert this link:
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/5f12df0b61.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

# Testing

I used html and css validators:
https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input

I deployed my site by:
* go to GitHub [repo](https://github.com/CaoiveMcTigue/portfolio-1)

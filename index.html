            <h2> Take Care of Yourself!</h2>
            <p>Self care is an important activity that is over seen by many. Deciding to take care of yourself, mentally and physically, is one
                of the best things you can do for yourself and your loved ones. Doing so will lead towards better improved overall health and wellness.
                Taking time to take care of yourself is not selfish and should be part of everyone's everyday activies.
            </p>
            <h2>So where do I start?</h2>
            <p>The simpliest thing to do is, take time to do something you love or something that relaxes you and makes you happy.
                It can be anything from exercising, painting, watching your faviourite show, having a bath and lighting some candles. 
                It really doesnt matter what it is once, you are happy and feel good about yourself afterwards.
            </p>
